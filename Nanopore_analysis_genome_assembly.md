# Genome assembly from Nanopore data

When investigating large scale genomic changes, or novel genomes, rather than aligning your sequence data to the reference genome, it is important to create a genome assembly so that we can identify novel changes.

Genome assembly requires more data, and a higher sequence coverage than sequencing your isolates and mapping this data to a reference genome.

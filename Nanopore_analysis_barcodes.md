# Code for custom internal barcode detection from nanopore amplicon sequencing 

This page will take you through the basic steps of analysis involved:

**>Basecalling**

**>Coverage analysis**

**> Extracting the number of reads mapping to specific internal barcodes**




* *Insert figure for analysis pipeline here* * 


## 1) Set up your environment for sequence analysis

Firstly, migrate to your terminal, and log in to your account on the server, you will be prompted for your password (ask me if you do not know)

```
ssh username@10.18.0.26
```

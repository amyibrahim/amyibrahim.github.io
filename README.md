Amy Ibrahim

Research Fellow

Moon Group, LSHTM, London


## Research

I work within the Moon Group at LSHTM investigating how the inrtacellular parasite, _Plasmodium knowlesi_ invades human erythrocytes. My research is funded under a Wellcome Trust Discovery Award. I use CRISPR-Cas9 based genome editing to target known and unknown genes associated with erythrocyte invasion and investigate parasite phenotypes. 

Previously, I have worked on whole genomoe sequencing for malaria parasites, using both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore systems, and I use the Nanopore MinION frequently to assess the genomics of modified parasite lines.
